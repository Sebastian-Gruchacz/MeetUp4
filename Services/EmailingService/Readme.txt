This "Service" is responsible for both persistence of email meta-data (with attachments) in DB as well as for physical receiving and sending them using external services / libraries.

For simplicity, only crucial code has been placed here. 

During the workshop I'm going to split the responsibility more among various classes, but will definitely have no time to cleanup project itself, especially how templates are retrieved... 
Treat it as your individual exercise ;-)
